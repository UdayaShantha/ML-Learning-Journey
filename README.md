# ML-Learning-Journey

This is my turning pont project on ML. This is the way that how I have learnt Machine Learning with Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Laerning algorithms with basic ML concepts.<br><br>

This give me the better hands on experience on ML and working with large data sets with engaging NumPy, Pandas, MatplotLib, Seaborn like ML related Libraries <br><br>

And also here I added the basic concepts on Computer Vision with OpenCV hands on expoeriences and the implementations on face recognition with Mediapipe.
